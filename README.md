# RESTFUL_PY_TTS_SERVER

Made it so that I get an unlimited access to my own TTS restful server (temporarily used till a better API is found)

## Installation: python 3.7 or higher

## Prerequisite:
	pip install flask  
	pip install pyttsx3  
	
	if received errors such as No module named win32com.client, No module named win32, or No module named win32api, additionally install pypiwin32
